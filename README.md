#Â OVERVIEW
Implement a class (or hierarchy of classes) that allows the management of a data set with a tree structure. Each tree is composed of nodes that have a unique identifier and, possibly, a set of child nodes.

# FUNCTIONALITY
It is required that features are implemented for:
a. insertion of a new node given the id of the father
b. search for a node (given the id) within the entire tree
c. print the entire tree in HTML making the structure through the use of lists
nested (ul or ol)
